## Spiderman
What can spider bite do? Let me rephrase it, what can a radioactive spider's bite do?
Well if you want to know then ask **peter parker**. A nerdy teenager who was like any random teenager in your neighbourhood, got the following superpowers after they bite
* superhuman strength
* Super agility
* Super speed
* ability to throw web slingshots
* spidey sense


His abilities know no bound, he was able overpower bucky, hit a few shots on Thanos, send off a big portion of outriders while protecting the gauntlet.
